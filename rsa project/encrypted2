If you want to add your project folders to a Git repository directly on GitHub without using command-line Git, you can do so using the GitHub web interface. Here are the steps:

Create a GitHub Repository:

Go to the GitHub website (https://github.com) and log in to your account.

Click on the "+" sign in the upper right corner of the page and select "New repository."

Fill in the repository name, description, and other settings as needed.

Choose whether the repository should be public or private, depending on your needs.

Click the "Create repository" button.

Upload Your Project Folders:

On the new repository's page, you'll find a section labeled "Quick setup." You'll see options for creating a new repository or pushing an existing repository from the command line. However, you want to directly upload your project folders, so ignore these options.

Click on the "Upload files" button, which is located near the bottom of the page.

In the file upload interface, drag and drop your project folders or click the "Choose your files" button to browse your local files and select the folders you want to upload.

You can also include a commit message describing the initial upload.

Once you've added your project folders, click the "Commit changes" button.
Commit Your Changes:
After you commit your changes, GitHub will process the files and add them to your repository.
View Your Project:
You'll now see your project folders and files in the GitHub repository.
Please note that this method is suitable for small projects. If you have a large project with many files or want to take advantage of advanced Git features, using Git on the command line or through a Git GUI tool is recommended
