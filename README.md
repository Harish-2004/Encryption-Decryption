# Encryption-Decryption
In our project, the data from a file is sent in a compressed manner while also receiving additional
protection. We are utilising the Huffman algorithm to compress the data. This approach uses graphs
to represent the data, which produces binary data that will be converted into character data to
reduce file size. In addition, we add additional security for this data using the RSA algorithm and
keys. The Huffmann algorithm will be used to decode the data after decryption.
